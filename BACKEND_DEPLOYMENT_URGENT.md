# üö® URGENT: Backend Deployment Required

**Status**: CRITICAL - Trial activation is blocked until backend is deployed
**Latest Backend Commit**: `4908ad8` - Authorization header fixes
**Deployed Backend URL**: https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE

The backend fixes are committed to GitHub but **NOT YET DEPLOYED** to production!

**What's Broken**:
- ‚ùå Trial activation fails with "An unexpected error occurred"
- ‚ùå Users cannot sign in
- ‚ùå Dashboard is inaccessible
- ‚ùå UserMenu feature cannot be tested

**Why**: The backend at `https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app` is still running the OLD code with the "Authorisation" header bug.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed (Commit 4908ad8)

1. **trialAuthRoutes.ts** - Changed to check `authorization` header
2. **index.ts** - Changed CORS to allow `Authorization` header

**Without these fixes deployed**: Frontend sends "Authorization" ‚Üí Backend expects "Authorisation" ‚Üí Authentication fails

---

## üöÄ Deploy Backend to Vercel NOW

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find Backend Project**: Look for "restore-assist-backend" or similar
3. **Click the project**
4. **Go to Deployments tab**
5. **Click "..." on latest deployment**
6. **Click "Redeploy"**
7. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for deployment to complete
8. **Verify** deployment shows "Ready" status

### Option 2: Vercel CLI (If Auto-Deploy Not Set Up)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g vercel

# Navigate to backend directory
cd packages/backend

# Build the backend
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Follow prompts to link to existing project
```

### Option 3: GitHub Integration (If Configured)

If Vercel is connected to your GitHub repo:
1. Vercel should auto-deploy when you pushed commit `4908ad8`
2. Check Vercel dashboard for in-progress deployment
3. Wait for it to complete (2-5 minutes)
4. If not auto-deploying, check Vercel settings ‚Üí Git integration

---

## üîç Verify Backend Deployment

Once deployed, test the backend is working:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","environment":"production","uptime":...}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel backend project settings:

**Required**:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for signing JWT tokens
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Frontend URL (https://restoreassist.app)

**Optional**:
- `SENTRY_DSN` - Error tracking
- `DATABASE_URL` - If using database

To set environment variables:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Backend Project
2. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add/update variables
4. Redeploy after adding variables

---

## üìã Post-Deployment Testing

After backend is deployed:

1. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for Vercel deployment to complete
2. **Hard refresh frontend**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
3. **Go to**: https://restoreassist.app
4. **Click**: "Sign in with Google"
5. **Expected**: Trial activation succeeds ‚úÖ
6. **Expected**: Redirected to Dashboard ‚úÖ
7. **Expected**: See UserMenu avatar in top-right ‚úÖ

---

## üêõ If Trial Activation Still Fails

### Check 1: Backend Deployed?
```bash
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/health
```

Should return healthy status. If 404/error, backend not deployed.

### Check 2: Correct Backend Version?
Check Vercel deployment logs:
- Look for commit hash in deployment
- Should be `4908ad8` or later

### Check 3: CORS Headers?
Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab:
- Try signing in
- Look for OPTIONS request to backend
- Check Response Headers for "Access-Control-Allow-Headers"
- Should include "Authorization"

### Check 4: Frontend Environment Variable?
The frontend `.env.production` should have:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app
```

This is set in Vercel frontend project environment variables.

## üìû Next Steps

**RIGHT NOW**:
1. ‚úÖ Deploy backend to Vercel (see options above)
2. ‚úÖ Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment
3. ‚úÖ Test health endpoint
4. ‚úÖ Hard refresh frontend
5. ‚úÖ Try signing in again

**Expected Timeline**:
- Backend deployment: 2-5 minutes
- Frontend hard refresh: instant
- Trial activation: Should work immediately

---

## üéØ Summary

**Problem**: Backend still has old "Authorisation" code
**Solution**: Deploy backend with commit `4908ad8`
**How**: Use Vercel dashboard redeploy or CLI
**When**: RIGHT NOW - blocking all users

**After deployment**: Trial activation will work, users can sign in, UserMenu will be visible!

**Created**: October 21, 2025
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Action**: Deploy backend to Vercel immediately
