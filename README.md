## Google OAuth Troubleshooting

### Common Authentication Issues

#### Issue: "Sign in was cancelled" or Popup Closes Immediately

**Cause:** Google OAuth popup was closed before completing authentication.

**Solutions:**
- Don't close the popup window manually
- Check if popup blocker is preventing the OAuth window from opening
- Try disabling browser extensions that might interfere
- Use Incognito/Private mode to test without extensions

---

#### Issue: "Access was denied" or "access_blocked"

**Cause:** Google OAuth app is in "Testing" mode and your email is not whitelisted.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your email is added to test users in Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**
   - Scroll to **Test users** section
   - Click **+ ADD USERS** and add your email address
   - Save changes

2. Wait 10-15 minutes for changes to propagate

3. Clear browser cache and cookies for `localhost` and `restoreassist.app`

4. Whitelisted test users:
   - airestoreassist@gmail.com
   - phill.mcgurk@gmail.com
   - zenithfresh25@gmail.com

---

#### Issue: "redirect_uri_mismatch"

**Cause:** OAuth callback URL not authorized in Google Cloud Console.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
   - Click your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Check **Authorized redirect URIs** includes:
     - `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`
     - `https://restoreassist.app/auth/callback`
     - `http://localhost:5173` (for development)

2. Add missing URLs and save

3. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

---

#### Issue: "invalid_client" or "Client authentication failed"

**Cause:** Google Client ID or Client Secret is incorrect or missing.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Backend .env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

   # Frontend .env
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```

2. Ensure Client ID matches exactly (no extra spaces or quotes)

3. Regenerate Client Secret if unsure:
   - Go to Google Cloud Console > **Credentials**
   - Delete old Client Secret
   - Create new Client Secret
   - Update both backend and frontend .env files

4. Restart development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

#### Issue: "You have already used your free trial"

**Cause:** Trial fraud detection detected previous trial usage.

**Solutions:**
1. **Legitimate Users:** Contact support at support@restoreassist.com.au with your email address

2. **Developers/Testing:** Use admin API to clear trial data:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin-trial/clear-trial/your-email@example.com
   ```

3. **Fraud Prevention Limits:**
   - 1 trial per email address
   - 1 trial per device (based on fingerprint)
   - If fraud score exceeds 70, trial is blocked

4. See [Fraud Detection Documentation](tests/e2e-claude/auth/fraud-detection.spec.ts) for details

---

#### Issue: Authentication Succeeds but Dashboard Shows Loading Forever

**Cause:** JWT token not being set correctly or session not created.

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 > Console)

2. Verify cookies are being set:
   - F12 > Application > Cookies
   - Look for `auth_token` or `access_token`
   - Should be `httpOnly` and `secure` (in production)

3. Check API response:
   ```bash
   # Get current user
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/trial-auth/me \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

4. Verify backend logs:
   ```bash
   # Should see:
   # ✅ Auth successful: [attempt-id] - user@example.com
   ```

5. Check database for user and session records:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE user_id = 'user-xxx';
   ```

---

#### Issue: "This device has already been used for a free trial"

**Cause:** Device fingerprint matches a previous trial activation.

**Solutions:**
1. **Legitimate Users:** Contact support for device reset

2. **Developers:** Clear device fingerprint:
   ```bash
   # Clear browser storage
   # F12 > Application > Clear storage

   # Or use admin API
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/admin-trial/clear-trial/your-email@example.com
   ```

3. **Understanding Device Fingerprinting:**
   - Based on: IP address, user agent, canvas fingerprint, WebGL, timezone, screen resolution
   - Hash stored in `device_fingerprints` table
   - Max 1 trial per device by default

---

#### Issue: OAuth Works Locally but Fails in Production

**Cause:** Production URLs not configured correctly.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify production URLs in Google Cloud Console:
   - Authorized JavaScript origins: `https://restoreassist.app`
   - Authorized redirect URIs: `https://restoreassist.app/auth/callback`

2. Check environment variables on Vercel/production:
   ```bash
   # Ensure these match production:
   VITE_APP_URL=https://restoreassist.app
   VITE_API_URL=https://api.restoreassist.app
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-production-client-id
   ```

3. Verify CORS settings allow production domain

4. Check SSL certificate is valid (required for OAuth)

---

### Debugging Tools

#### View Authentication Logs

Backend logs show auth attempts in real-time:

```bash
# Successful login
✅ Auth successful: attempt-abc123 - user@example.com

# Failed login
❌ Auth failed: attempt-def456 - access_denied
```

#### Check Auth Success Rate

Backend displays auth metrics on startup:

```bash
🔐 Auth success rate (24h): 85.3% (120/141 attempts)
```

#### Database Queries

```sql
-- Recent auth attempts
SELECT * FROM auth_attempts
ORDER BY attempted_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Failed attempts by error code
SELECT oauth_error_code, COUNT(*) as count
FROM auth_attempts
WHERE success = false
GROUP BY oauth_error_code
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Suspicious IPs (high failure rate)
SELECT ip_address, COUNT(*) as failures
FROM auth_attempts
WHERE success = false
  AND attempted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY ip_address
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10;
```

#### Sentry Error Monitoring

Failed auth attempts are automatically sent to Sentry with:
- Error code and message
- Sanitized email (***@domain.com)
- Sanitized IP (192.168.x.x)
- Retry count and error type tags

View in Sentry dashboard: Issues tagged with `auth_failure`

---

### Test User Mode

For development and testing without Google OAuth:

1. Enable test mode in backend `.env`:
   ```bash
   TEST_USER_MODE=true
   ```

2. Frontend will show "Sign in as Test User" button

3. Test user bypasses fraud detection and OAuth flow

4. See [Test User Mode Spec](tests/e2e-claude/auth/test-user-mode.spec.ts)
