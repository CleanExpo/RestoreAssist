## Component Index File

**File**: `packages/frontend/src/components/ascora/index.ts`

Provides centralized exports for all components and types:

import { AscoraConnect, AscoraStatus, AscoraJobList } from '@/components/ascora';
import type { AscoraJob, AscoraCustomer } from '@/components/ascora';
```

## Common Patterns Across All Components

### 1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**
- All components use strict TypeScript with proper typing
- No `any` types used
- Comprehensive interface definitions
- Type-safe props

### 2. **State Management**
- Custom hooks for data fetching and operations
- Local state for UI interactions
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- User-friendly error messages
- Clear error states with dismissible alerts
- Retry mechanisms

### 4. **Loading States**
- Skeleton screens or spinners during data loading
- Disabled states for buttons during operations
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- Tailwind CSS utility classes throughout
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Responsive tables with horizontal scroll
- Adaptive grid layouts

### 6. **Accessibility**
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance

### 7. **Performance Optimizations**
- useMemo for expensive calculations
- useCallback for event handlers
- Pagination to limit DOM elements
- Lazy loading where appropriate

## Integration with Custom Hooks

All components integrate seamlessly with the custom hooks:

| Component | Primary Hook | Secondary Hooks |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| AscoraConnect | useAscora | - |
| AscoraStatus | useAscora | useAscoraSync |
| AscoraJobCreator | useAscoraJobs | useAscoraCustomers |
| AscoraJobList | useAscoraJobs | - |
| AscoraCustomerSync | useAscoraCustomers | useAscora |
| AscoraInvoiceManager | Direct API calls | - |
| AscoraSync Manager | useAscoraSync | - |

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Setting Up Ascora Integration
```typescript
import { AscoraConnect, AscoraStatus } from '@/components/ascora';

function IntegrationPage() {
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);

  if (!isConnected) {
    return (
      <AscoraConnect
        organizationId={orgId}
        userId={userId}
        onConnected={() => setIsConnected(true)}
      />
    );
  }

  return <AscoraStatus organizationId={orgId} />;
}
```

### Example 2: Creating Jobs from Reports
```typescript
import { AscoraJobCreator } from '@/components/ascora';

function ReportDetailPage({ reportId }) {
  return (
    <AscoraJobCreator
      organizationId={orgId}
      reportId={reportId}
      onJobCreated={(jobId, ascoraJobId) => {
        console.log(`Job created: ${jobId} → ${ascoraJobId}`);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Example 3: Managing Invoices
```typescript
import { AscoraInvoiceManager } from '@/components/ascora';

function InvoicesPage() {
  return (
    <AscoraInvoiceManager
      organizationId={orgId}
      onPaymentRecorded={(invoiceId) => {
        toast.success('Payment recorded successfully');
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Example 4: Monitoring Sync Operations
```typescript
import { AscoraSync Manager } from '@/components/ascora';

function SyncMonitorPage() {
  return (
    <AscoraSync Manager
      organizationId={orgId}
      autoRefresh={true}
      refreshInterval={30000}
    />
  );
}
```
