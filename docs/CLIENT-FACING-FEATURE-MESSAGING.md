## Marketing Messaging

### Headline
**"Strengthen Your Reports with Official Regulatory Citations"**

### Subheading
**Optional enhancement that adds authority and credibility to forensic reports**

### Body Copy

```
Professional restoration requires more than IICRC standards—it demands
compliance with Australian building codes, electrical standards, and consumer
protection laws.

RestoreAssist now gives you the option to include official regulatory citations
in your forensic reports. These citations automatically pull relevant standards
based on the damage type and location, making your reports more authoritative
and easier for insurers to verify.

✓ Building Codes (NCC 2025 + State-Specific)
✓ Electrical Standards (AS/NZS 3000)
✓ Consumer Protection Laws
✓ Insurance Compliance Requirements
✓ Climate-Appropriate Drying Standards

It's optional. It's free. It makes a difference.

## How to Introduce in Sales Calls

### Option 1: Lead with Authority (Insurance Adjusters)
> "One thing we've been adding based on adjuster feedback is the ability to include official Australian building codes and standards in reports. It makes verification easier and gives adjusters hard evidence to back up claim decisions. Want to see how that looks?"

### Option 2: Lead with Simplicity (Restoration Owners)
> "We've made something that might interest you—optional regulatory citations. Basically, when you generate a report, you can choose to include building codes and compliance standards relevant to that specific job. It's one checkbox. No extra work for you, but it makes your reports look more professional."

### Option 3: Lead with Results (Claims Managers)
> "Our clients are seeing faster claim approvals with the new regulatory citation feature. The idea is simple: instead of clients just seeing recommendations, they see those recommendations backed up by actual building codes and standards. What problems are you seeing with claims that this might help with?"

## Feature Walkthrough Script

### Scenario: Showing toggle in report form

**Step 1: Create Report**
> "So you create a new water damage report like normal. Fill in the standard info—water category, location, all that."

**Step 2: Highlight Toggle**
> "Now you'll notice this section here: 'Include Regulatory Citations.' It's a checkbox—nothing fancy. This is optional. You can check it or not."

**Step 3: Expand Details**
> "Click to expand and you can see exactly what gets included: Building codes for the state, electrical standards if electrical work is needed, consumer protection info, insurance requirements. And it's all automatically selected based on your report details."

**Step 4: Show Benefits**
> "The main benefit? When you generate the PDF, instead of just showing IICRC standards, it'll also include a 'Regulatory Compliance Summary' section with all the official Australian standards that apply. Makes the report way more credible."

**Step 5: Clarify It's Optional**
> "But here's the thing—if you don't want it, just leave it unchecked. Nothing changes. You get the same professional report you always do with just IICRC standards. It's just an option."

## FAQ for Clients

### Q: What are regulatory citations?
A: They're official references to Australian building codes, electrical standards, and consumer protection laws that apply to restoration work. Basically, they're the "why" behind what you need to do—the legal and regulatory basis for remediation recommendations.

### Q: Who decides which citations appear?
A: Our system automatically selects them based on your damage type, location, and the materials involved. If it's water damage in Queensland with electrical work needed, it'll pull relevant citations for those specific conditions.

### Q: Do I have to include them?
A: Nope. It's completely optional. We added it because some clients asked for more regulatory backing, but plenty of clients are happy with just IICRC standards. Your choice per report.

### Q: Do they cost extra?
A: No. It's included in RestoreAssist at no additional charge.

### Q: Will IICRC standards still be included?
A: Yes. IICRC S500, S520, and other standards are always included regardless of this option. Regulatory citations are just additional.

### Q: Can I change my mind after generating a report?
A: Absolutely. You can change the setting for each report and regenerate the PDF anytime.

### Q: Why would I want to include them?
A: A few reasons:
- Insurance claims often move faster with regulatory documentation
- It shows clients you're following all relevant Australian standards
- Professional appearance with authoritative references
- Makes it harder for insurers to dispute your recommendations

### Q: What if they're wrong or not applicable?
A: That's unlikely—our system is careful to only include citations that are actually relevant. But if you ever see something off, let us know. We're still refining this feature.

### Q: What reports can have regulatory citations?
A: Water damage, mould remediation, and fire damage reports. The system automatically selects standards relevant to the damage type.

### Q: Do I need to understand the regulations?
A: No. The citations are there to support your recommendations, not for you to interpret. Think of them as "proof" that what you're recommending is right.

### Q: Will my clients understand these references?
A: They don't need to. But they'll appreciate that you're following official standards. Insurers will definitely understand and appreciate the references.

### Q: What if the feature is disabled?
A: The toggle just won't appear. You'll get reports like you do now—IICRC standards only. No change in functionality.

### Q: How do I know it won't break my PDFs?
A: We've tested extensively. The feature is completely optional and additive. If something goes wrong, the system falls back to IICRC-only reports automatically.

## Support Response Templates

### Customer Asks: "Should I always use regulatory citations?"

> "That's completely up to you! Many of our clients use them to support insurance claims, especially for complex jobs. Others are happy with just IICRC standards. It really depends on your workflow and what your clients expect. You can try it on a few reports and see if it makes a difference for you."

### Customer Asks: "Will this slow down PDF generation?"

> "Nope. Whether you include regulatory citations or not, PDF generation is quick. The citations are already selected based on your report details, so it's just adding them to the PDF you were already generating. Performance is the same either way."

### Customer Asks: "Can I turn this off?"

> "Yes. The toggle is right in the report form. You can include regulatory citations for one report and not for another. Or if you don't want to see the toggle at all, let us know and we can hide it for your account."
