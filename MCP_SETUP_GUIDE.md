## ðŸš€ After You Have the Credentials

Once you have the API keys/tokens above:

1. Let me know you're ready
2. I'll update your `mcp.json` configuration
3. You'll restart Claude Code
4. All MCPs will be fully functional!

## ðŸ“‹ Credentials Checklist

- [ ] Stripe API Key obtained
- [ ] Vercel Token obtained
- [ ] Google Cloud CLI installed & authenticated (optional)

## Notes

- **Test vs Production**: Stripe has test and live keys - use test for development
- **Security**: Never commit these keys to git repositories
- **Expiration**: Vercel tokens can expire - create new ones as needed
- **Scopes**: Ensure tokens have appropriate permissions for your needs

## Quick Copy Format

When ready, provide me with:

```bash
# Stripe
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here

# Vercel
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Google Cloud (optional)
# Already authenticated via gcloud CLI
```

I'll update your configuration automatically!
