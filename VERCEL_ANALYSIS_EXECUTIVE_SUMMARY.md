# Vercel Deployment Configuration Analysis - Executive Summary

**Analysis Date:** October 21, 2025
**Project:** RestoreAssist (Monorepo: Frontend + Backend)
**Status:** DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED - Requires Dashboard Configuration

---

## Key Findings

### Overall Status: 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE - Configuration Required

The RestoreAssist backend deployment is **blocked by a single configuration setting** that must be changed in the Vercel Dashboard. All code is ready and working locally.

---

## The Problem (In Plain English)

**What's happening:** When you deploy to Vercel, the system looks for serverless functions at the repository root (`/api/`) but RestoreAssist stores them in a subdirectory (`/packages/backend/api/`).

**Result:** Vercel cannot find the functions → All API calls fail with `INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`

**Root cause:** The Vercel project's "Root Directory" setting is still pointing to `.` (repository root) instead of `packages/backend`

---

## The Fix (5 Minutes)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select the **"restore-assist-backend"** project
3. Click **Settings** → **General**
4. Find **"Root Directory"** field
5. Change from `.` to `packages/backend`
6. Click **Save**
7. Click **Deployments** → Latest deployment → **Redeploy**
8. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

**After this, test:** `https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/health`

|------|--------|---------|
| **TypeScript Compilation** | ✅ FIXED | All build errors resolved |
| **Express App Loading** | ✅ FIXED | Loads correctly from dist/ |
| **Environment Variables** | ✅ CONFIGURED | All 26+ variables set in Vercel |
| **Error Handling** | ✅ ENHANCED | Comprehensive diagnostics added |
| **Database Connection** | ✅ MITIGATED | Lazy loading implemented for cold starts |
| **Dependencies** | ✅ CLEANED | UUID package replaced with native crypto |
| **Stripe Integration** | ✅ CONFIGURED | Webhook and products configured |

## What Still Needs Attention ⚠️

### Critical (Blocks Deployment)
- [ ] Vercel Root Directory setting → `packages/backend`
- [ ] Framework Preset setting → `Other` (not Next.js)

### Important (After Basic Deployment)
- [ ] Test all endpoints to verify setup
- [ ] Monitor Vercel logs during first requests
- [ ] Configure custom domain (if needed)

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Enable Agent SDK when package available
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Add Sentry monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting

## Deployment Configuration Files Found

### Backend Configuration
```

└── projectId: prj_kUEaAIULM3sLSE3S58mq52fOKkEf
```

### Frontend Configuration
```
packages/frontend/vercel.json
├── framework: vite
├── buildCommand: npm run build
├── outputDirectory: dist
└── rewrites: SPA routing to /index.html
```

### Deployment Files
```
packages/backend/api/
├── index.js       ← Main Express handler
├── test.js        ← Diagnostic endpoint

## Environment Variables Status

**All 26+ variables configured in Vercel:**

✅ Core Configuration (NODE_ENV, JWT secrets, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
✅ Stripe Integration (API keys, webhook secret, product IDs)
✅ Database (Supabase configuration)
✅ Google OAuth (client ID and secret)
✅ CORS (allowed origins)

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Monorepo Path Resolution ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Problem:** Functions not discoverable in packages/backend/api/
**Cause:** Root Directory not configured in Vercel dashboard
**Solution:** Set Root Directory to `packages/backend`
**Impact:** BLOCKS ALL DEPLOYMENTS
**Fix Time:** 5 minutes

### Issue #2: Framework Detection ⚠️ HIGH

**Problem:** Vercel might detect as Next.js instead of Express
**Cause:** Framework Preset not explicitly set
**Solution:** Set Framework Preset to `Other`
**Impact:** Functions won't be recognized even if Root Directory is correct
**Fix Time:** 1 minute

### Issue #3: Deprecated UUID Package ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Problem:** uuid@13.0.0 is deprecated
**Cause:** Listed in package.json dependencies
**Solution:** Remove from dependencies (already using crypto module)
**Current Status:** PARTIALLY MITIGATED - Code uses crypto, dependency unused
**Fix Time:** 5 minutes

### Issue #4: Agent SDK Unavailable ⚠️ LOW

**Problem:** @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk package not available
**Cause:** Package version/availability issue
**Solution:** Falls back to ClaudeService
**Impact:** Reports work, but without Agent SDK features
**Workaround:** Already implemented

---

## Testing Endpoints

Once deployment is fixed, test in this order:

```bash
# 1. Ultra-minimal test (checks Vercel can execute ANY function)
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/hello

# 2. Diagnostic endpoint (checks runtime environment)
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/test

# 3. Health check (checks Express app loaded)
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/health

# 4. Authentication (checks core functionality)
curl -X POST https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@restoreassist.com","password":"admin123"}'

# 5. Stripe webhook test (from Stripe dashboard)
# Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
# Select your webhook → "Send test webhook" → choose checkout.session.completed
```

2. Set Root Directory to `packages/backend`
3. Set Framework Preset to `Other`
4. Redeploy

### 🟡 NEXT (15 Minutes)

✅ `/api/auth/login` successfully authenticates
✅ Stripe webhooks process without errors
✅ No INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED errors
✅ Build logs show successful TypeScript compilation
✅ Runtime logs show proper initialization

---

## Technical Details

### Build Process
1. Vercel clones repository
2. Sets working directory to `packages/backend` (ONCE ROOT DIRECTORY IS SET)
3. Runs: `npm run build` → TypeScript compiles to dist/
4. Runs: `npm run vercel:prepare` → verification script
5. Discovers serverless functions in api/*.js
6. Deploys functions to Vercel edge network

### Runtime Flow
1. Request arrives at https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/*
2. Vercel routes to `/packages/backend/api/index.js` (once Root Directory set)
3. index.js loads Express app from `../dist/index.js`
4. Express routes request to appropriate handler
5. Response returned to client

### File Structure
```
packages/backend/
├── api/
│   ├── index.js          ← Vercel entry point
│   ├── test.js           ← Diagnostics endpoint
│   └── hello.js          ← Minimal test
├── src/                  ← TypeScript source
├── dist/                 ← Compiled JavaScript (created by tsc)
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── vercel.json           ← Build configuration
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't** set Root Directory to `.` → Won't find functions
❌ **Don't** set Framework to Next.js → Expects pages/api/ structure
❌ **Don't** set Build Command in dashboard → Use vercel.json instead
❌ **Don't** skip environment variables → Many are required
❌ **Don't** commit .vercel/ folder → Already in .gitignore

**Analysis Type:** Comprehensive Vercel Deployment Configuration Review
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## Questions?

If after applying these fixes the backend still doesn't deploy:

1. Check Vercel Runtime Logs: Dashboard → Deployments → Functions → Runtime Logs
2. Check Build Logs: Dashboard → Deployments → Build Logs
3. Verify TypeScript compilation in build logs
4. Verify all 26 environment variables are set
5. Check .vercelignore doesn't exclude api/ folder

If you get stuck, share the **Runtime Logs** from the Vercel dashboard - they contain the specific error preventing deployment.
