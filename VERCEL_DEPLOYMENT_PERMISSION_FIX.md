# üî¥ Vercel Team Permission Issue - Quick Fix

## ‚úÖ QUICKEST FIX: Trigger Deployment from Vercel Dashboard

Since you've already configured the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard, the easiest solution is to trigger a deployment from there:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/unite-group/restore-assist-backend

2. **Check if project exists**:
   - If you see the project ‚Üí Continue to step 3
   - If "Project not found" ‚Üí See Option B below

3. **Go to Deployments tab**

4. **Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"**
   - If there's a previous deployment, click the "..." menu ‚Üí "Redeploy"
   - If no deployments exist, click "Deploy" and select the `main` branch

5. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for deployment to complete

6. **Verify**:
   ```bash
   curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

## üîß Option B: Add Git User to Team (Permanent Fix)

If the restore-assist-backend project doesn't exist or you want CLI deployments to work:

1. **Go to Vercel Team Settings**: https://vercel.com/teams/unite-group/settings/members

2. **Invite Member**:
   - Email: CleanExpo@users.noreply.github.com
   - OR: Find the GitHub user "CleanExpo" and invite them

3. **Set Role**: Member or Owner

4. **Accept Invitation** (if sent to email)

5. **Redeploy**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/backend
   vercel --prod --yes
   ```

## üîÑ Option C: Connect GitHub Integration

If the restore-assist-backend project exists but has no deployments:

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/unite-group/restore-assist-backend/settings/git

2. **Connect Git Repository**:

## üéØ Recommended Approach

**If you already configured environment variables** ‚Üí Use Option A (Dashboard Redeploy)

## üß™ After Deployment - Test

Once deployed, verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Test backend health
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","environment":"production","uptime":...}

# 2. Test trial auth endpoint
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/trial-auth/health

# Expected: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

Then test sign-in:
1. Go to: https://restoreassist.app
2. Click "Sign up with Google"
3. Complete OAuth
4. Should redirect to Dashboard ‚úÖ
5. Should see UserMenu avatar ‚úÖ
