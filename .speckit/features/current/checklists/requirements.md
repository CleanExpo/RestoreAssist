# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Google OAuth Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes:**
- Specification maintains user-centric language throughout
- Technical details (e.g., `@react-oauth/google`) mentioned only as existing constraints, not proposed solutions
- Business value and user impact clearly articulated

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes:**
- All 8 functional requirements include explicit testability statements
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (95% success rate, 7 seconds completion time, etc.)
- Success criteria avoid implementation specifics (e.g., "sign-up process feels smooth" not "React components render fast")
- 10 edge cases documented with handling strategies
- Clear in-scope/out-of-scope boundaries prevent scope creep

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes:**
- Each FR includes detailed acceptance criteria in testable format
- 4 user scenarios cover: primary flow, error handling, test user mode, multiple failures
- Success criteria include both quantitative (95% success rate) and qualitative (user satisfaction) measures
- Specification maintains "what/why" focus without prescribing "how"

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All checklist items satisfied

**Strengths:**
1. Comprehensive edge case coverage (10 scenarios identified)
2. Clear measurable success criteria with specific metrics
3. Well-defined scope boundaries prevent feature creep
4. User scenarios include both happy path and error handling
5. Non-functional requirements cover performance, security, reliability, observability
6. Assumptions documented to clarify context
7. Dependencies and constraints explicitly listed

**Areas for Review:**
- None identified - specification is ready for planning phase

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation architecture
2. Review fraud detection thresholds (currently hardcoded at 1 trial/email)
3. Verify Google OAuth configuration propagation has completed before testing
