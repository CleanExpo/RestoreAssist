# Security Fix: Removed API Key Storage from localStorage

## Date: October 22, 2024

## Critical Security Issue Fixed
- **Issue**: API keys were being stored in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks
- **Impact**: High - API keys could be stolen if an XSS vulnerability exists anywhere in the application
- **Solution**: Removed API key storage from localStorage and added security warnings

## Changes Made

### 1. **FreeTrialLanding.tsx** (Lines 118-123)
**Before:**
```typescript
const mockAnthropicKey = 'sk-ant-dev-mock-key-for-screenshot-testing-only-' + Date.now();
localStorage.setItem('anthropic_api_key', mockAnthropicKey);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// SECURITY: API keys should NEVER be stored in localStorage
// TODO: Implement secure httpOnly cookie-based authentication for API keys
console.log('ðŸ”’ SECURITY: API key storage in localStorage has been removed');
```

### 2. **ApiKeyManager.tsx**
**Changes:**
- Line 3-5: Added security warning comment
- Lines 10-19: Added warning when reading existing keys from localStorage
- Lines 17-29: Disabled localStorage.setItem for API keys, shows memory-only warning
- API keys are now kept in memory only (lost on refresh)

### 3. **api.ts** (Lines 5-17)
**Changes:**
- Added security comments about token storage
- Marked localStorage usage as temporary
- Added TODO for httpOnly cookie migration

## What Still Uses localStorage (Kept Intentionally)

These items are temporarily kept to avoid breaking the authentication flow:
1. **accessToken** - Authentication token (will migrate to httpOnly cookies)
2. **refreshToken** - Refresh token (will migrate to httpOnly cookies)
3. **sessionToken** - Session tracking (less sensitive, may keep)
4. **Theme settings** - Non-sensitive user preference (safe to keep)

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Implement httpOnly Cookie Authentication:**
   - Backend API to set httpOnly cookies on login
   - Remove localStorage usage for tokens
   - Add CSRF protection

2. **Secure API Key Storage:**
   - Store API keys encrypted in backend database
   - Retrieve via secure authenticated endpoint
   - Never expose keys to frontend JavaScript

3. **Complete Security Audit:**
   - Review all localStorage usage
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Add XSS protection headers

## Testing Verification

âœ… **Build Status**: Successfully builds with no TypeScript errors
âœ… **Dev Bypass**: Still functional for screenshot mode (without API key storage)
âœ… **Authentication Flow**: Preserved and working

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Never store sensitive data in localStorage** - It's accessible to any JavaScript code
2. **Use httpOnly cookies for tokens** - Prevents JavaScript access
3. **Encrypt sensitive data at rest** - API keys should be encrypted in database
4. **Implement defense in depth** - Multiple layers of security

## Files Modified

1. `packages/frontend/src/pages/FreeTrialLanding.tsx`
2. `packages/frontend/src/components/ApiKeyManager.tsx`
3. `packages/frontend/src/services/api.ts`

## Commit Message Suggestion

```
fix: CRITICAL - Remove API key storage from localStorage (XSS vulnerability)

- Removed mock API key storage from dev bypass
- Disabled API key localStorage.setItem in ApiKeyManager
- Added security warnings and TODOs for httpOnly cookie migration
- Kept auth tokens temporarily to avoid breaking authentication flow
- Phase 2 will implement secure httpOnly cookie authentication

Security: Prevents API key theft via XSS attacks
