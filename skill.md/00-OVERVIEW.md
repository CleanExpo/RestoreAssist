## Executive Summary

This skill.md folder contains the complete specification and implementation guide for the **National Inspection Report (NIR) Initiative** - a transformational project that standardizes inspection and scope-of-work reporting across the Australian restoration industry.

### The Problem Being Solved

- **50+ different report formats** used by restoration companies
- - **2-3 hours** spent by insurance adjusters decoding each report
  - - **20-30% of claims** require re-inspection due to missing data
    - - **Technician skill variance** causes report quality inconsistency
      - - **$2000-5000 extra cost per claim** from re-inspections, delays, and disputes
        - - Industry lacks professional credibility with amateur appearance
         
          - ### The Solution
         
          - A **single, standardized inspection and scope-of-work report format** that:
          - - ✅ Eliminates ambiguity (one format, one structure, one truth)
            - - ✅ Prevents re-inspections (complete, verified data first time)
              - - ✅ Enables unskilled technicians (system interprets, not person)
                - - ✅ Accelerates claims (adjusters understand instantly)
                  - - ✅ Reduces disputes (standards-justified scope)
                    - - ✅ Saves industry $625M-1B annually
                      - - ✅ Professionalizes the industry
