## Key Findings

### Root Cause: Identified ‚úÖ

**Problem:** `INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` errors on Vercel

**Cause:** Vercel Root Directory setting not configured

**Explanation:**
- Vercel deploys from repository root (`RestoreAssist/`)
- ServerlessAssist functions are in `packages/backend/api/`
- Current Root Directory setting: `.` (looks at wrong location)
- Required Root Directory setting: `packages/backend` (looks at correct location)

### Critical Issues: 2

1. **Root Directory** - Set to `.` instead of `packages/backend`
2. **Framework Preset** - May be set to Next.js instead of Other

### High Priority Issues: 3

1. Build output path verification
2. Cold start performance (already mitigated)
3. Deprecated uuid package (already mitigated)

### Already Fixed: 8+

‚úÖ TypeScript compilation errors
‚úÖ Express app loading
‚úÖ Environment file handling
‚úÖ Database lazy loading
‚úÖ UUID dependency replacement
‚úÖ Error handling improvements
‚úÖ CORS configuration
‚úÖ API entry points

---

## What's Production Ready

- ‚úÖ All TypeScript compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ Express app loads and runs correctly
- ‚úÖ All routes registered and functional
- ‚úÖ Error handling comprehensive

- ‚úÖ 26+ environment variables set

### Testing Level
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly locally
- ‚úÖ Builds successfully
- ‚úÖ Health checks pass
- ‚úÖ Authentication tested

### What's Needed to Go Live

‚ùå Set Root Directory to `packages/backend` in Vercel dashboard (1 minute)
‚ùå Set Framework Preset to `Other` in Vercel dashboard (1 minute)
‚ùå Redeploy (2-3 minutes)
‚ùå Test endpoints (5 minutes)

**Total time to production: ~10 minutes**

## The Problem (In 30 Seconds)

Vercel is looking for your API functions in the wrong place.

```
Where Vercel is looking now:  RestoreAssist/api/
Where functions actually are: RestoreAssist/packages/backend/api/
```

Result: Functions can't be found ‚Üí All APIs fail

Fix: Tell Vercel to look in `packages/backend`

Where: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Root Directory

Time: 1 minute to change, 5 minutes to redeploy

---

## The Solution (In 30 Seconds)

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Open "restore-assist-backend" project
3. Click Settings ‚Üí General
4. Set Root Directory: `packages/backend`
5. Set Framework Preset: `Other`
6. Click Save
7. Redeploy latest deployment
8. Wait 3 minutes
9. Test: `https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/health`
10. Should see: `{"status":"healthy"...}`

---

## Testing Instructions

### After applying the fix, test in this order:

**Test 1 - Ultra-minimal (confirms Vercel can execute ANY function)**
```bash
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/hello
```
Expected: `{"message":"Hello from Vercel!"}`

**Test 2 - Diagnostics (confirms environment variables loaded)**
```bash
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/test
```
Expected: `{"status":"ok","message":"...",...}`

**Test 3 - Health check (confirms Express app loaded)**
```bash
curl https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

**Test 4 - Authentication (confirms core functionality)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://restore-assist-backend.vercel.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@restoreassist.com","password":"admin123"}'
```
Expected: JWT tokens and user data

If all tests pass ‚Üí Deployment successful ‚úÖ
