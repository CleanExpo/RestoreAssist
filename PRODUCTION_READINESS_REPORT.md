## ❌ WHAT'S BROKEN (HONEST ASSESSMENT)

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Launch)

#### 1. Stripe Webhook Handlers ⚠️
**Impact:** Subscriptions won't process correctly after payment

**Problem:**
- Webhook events received but handlers don't update database
- Mock tests revealed implementation gaps
- Service methods not being called correctly

**Fix Required:**
- Review webhook handler logic in `stripeRoutes.ts`
- Ensure subscription service methods called
- Add proper error handling
- Test with actual Stripe webhooks (not just mocks)

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours

#### 2. Mobile OAuth Not Working ⚠️
**Impact:** Users on mobile can't sign up

**Problem:**
- Google OAuth iframe doesn't load on mobile viewport (390x844)
- Likely Google SDK limitation or responsive design issue

**Options:**
A. Implement mobile-specific auth flow (simpler button)
B. Mark mobile as "desktop-only" for now
C. Investigate Google SDK responsive settings

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours

### Non-Critical Issues (Can Launch Without)

#### 3. Admin Routes Need Auth 🔵
**Impact:** Admin features not accessible in tests

**Problem:**
- Admin endpoints require authentication
- Tests don't provide JWT tokens
- Routes return 401 Unauthorized

**Fix Required:**
- Implement TEST_MODE bypass, OR
- Skip admin tests (not customer-facing)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

## 🎯 GO/NO-GO ASSESSMENT

### Can You Launch NOW? ⚠️ **NO - WITH CAVEATS**

**Why Not:**
1. Stripe webhooks broken → payments won't complete properly

3. No production testing with real Stripe account

### Can You Launch in 1 WEEK? ✅ **YES**

**Required Work:**
1. **Day 1-2:** Fix Stripe webhook handlers (4 hours)
