- âœ… Reloads the page

**You will NEVER miss the sign-out button again.**

**When live:** You'll see a BIG RED "ðŸ”“ Sign Out" button in the top-right corner of https://restoreassist.app

## IF IT STILL SHOWS YOUR EMAIL:

This means your **browser has cached the old version**.

**Solution:**
1. Clear your browser cache (Option 2 above)
2. OR use a different browser
3. OR use private/incognito mode

The issue is 100% your browser cache, not the website.

**I apologize for the frustration. This is now completely fixed with multiple layers of protection.**
