## §G — Description (paste verbatim into "Description" field)

```
RestoreAssist is the all-in-one field and reporting platform built exclusively for Australian water damage, fire, and storm restoration professionals.

IICRC-COMPLIANT WORKFLOW
Conduct room-by-room inspections aligned with IICRC S500:2025, S520:2015, and S700:2015 standards. Record moisture readings, drying logs, equipment placements, and scope of works — all in a structured format that satisfies insurance and state building-authority requirements.

AI-POWERED EFFICIENCY
Point your camera at a moisture meter and let RestoreAssist read the value automatically. AI photo analysis eliminates manual data entry and reduces errors on site.

## §H — Encryption Export Compliance

Already declared per RA-1633 ("encryption export compliance declared"). For v1.0 build 1: **app uses standard encryption for HTTPS only — no proprietary encryption.** Answer the App Store Connect questionnaire accordingly:

- Does your app use encryption? **Yes**
- Does your app qualify for any of the exemptions? **Yes** — exempt under Section 740.17(b)(1) (uses HTTPS only via WKWebView, no proprietary crypto)
- Re-declare on each new version unless `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` is in `Info.plist`. (Recommended: add the key once, then no re-declaration needed.)

---

## §I — In-App Purchases / Subscriptions

For v1: **NO in-app purchases.** Subscription billing is processed via the web (Stripe), accessible after sign-in. Apple may request an explanation since restoration software is "Reader" category — confirm with App Review Notes (§E):

> "Subscriptions are processed by the operator company, not via Apple In-App Purchase. The app is provided free for active workspace members. Per Apple Guideline 3.1.3(a), this is permissible because subscription is purchased outside the app and the iOS app provides paid content access."

If Apple rejects under 3.1.3, the fallback is to add an In-App Purchase product matching the Pro tier and let users subscribe through Apple. File a follow-up ticket if this becomes a blocker.

## §K — After submission

| Step | What to do |
|---|---|
| 1. Status `Waiting for Review` | Apple's queue — typically 24-72h |
| 2. Status `In Review` | Active review — typically a few hours |
| 3. Status `Ready for Sale` (or rejected) | If approved → app goes live in AU + NZ; if rejected → read the reviewer's notes, fix, resubmit. Typical first-rejection reasons: insufficient reviewer notes (§E), missing demo account access, screenshot doesn't match actual app surface |
| 4. Phased Release (optional) | App Store Connect → Version → Phased Release → 7-day rollout. Recommended for v1.0. |
| 5. TestFlight retiring | Once Ready for Sale, retire TestFlight build 1.0(1) so external testers move to the App Store version |
