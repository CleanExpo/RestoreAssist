# Prompt Engineering Guide for RestoreAssist Reports

## Core Principles

When generating damage assessment reports, follow these principles:

1. **Accuracy First**: All costs, compliance notes, and technical details must be accurate
2. **Australian Context**: Always reference Australian standards, regulations, and market rates
3. **Professional Tone**: Industry-standard terminology, clear and authoritative
4. **Comprehensive**: Include all necessary details without being verbose
5. **Structured**: Follow the prescribed format consistently

## Report Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
- Start with urgency assessment (emergency, urgent, routine)
- Summarize primary damage and affected areas
- State total estimated cost prominently
- Mention immediate actions required
- Keep to 3-5 sentences

**Example:**
> "URGENT: Significant water damage to residential property from burst second-floor bathroom pipe. Water has penetrated ceiling and walls in living areas below, with visible staining and structural dampness. Total estimated restoration cost: $6,850 AUD (excl. GST). Immediate water extraction and structural drying required to prevent secondary mold damage. Work must comply with NCC 2022 Volume Two and Victorian Building Regulations 2018."

### 2. Scope of Work
- List tasks in sequential order
- Start with emergency/urgent tasks
- Group related activities
- Include verification/testing steps
- End with final inspections

**Structure:**
1. Emergency response (if applicable)
2. Assessment and testing
3. Demolition and removal
4. Drying and treatment
5. Repairs and reconstruction
6. Finishing work
7. Final verification

### 3. Itemized Estimate
- Group by category (Labor, Materials, Equipment, Disposal)
- Use realistic Australian market rates
- Be specific with descriptions
- Include appropriate quantities
- Calculate totals accurately

**Categories:**
- **Labor**: Hourly rates or fixed-price tasks
- **Materials**: Specific products with quantities
- **Equipment**: Daily/weekly hire rates
- **Disposal**: Waste removal and disposal fees
- **Testing**: Air quality, moisture, etc.
- **Permits**: If applicable

### 4. Compliance Notes
- Reference specific NCC 2022 sections
- Include state-specific regulations
- Mention required licenses/permits
- Note safety standards
- Reference industry standards (AS/NZS)

**Format:**
> "- Work complies with NCC 2022 Volume Two, Section 3.8 (Health and Amenity)"
> "- Victorian Building Regulations 2018 requirements met"
> "- Licensed plumber required for water system work (Victorian Building Authority)"
> "- AS/NZS 3500 Plumbing and Drainage Standards compliance"

### 5. Authority to Proceed
- Professional authorisation document
- Clear scope definition
- Liability disclaimers
- Cost breakdown summary
- Signature blocks

## Cost Estimation Guidelines

### Labor Rates (2024, per hour, excl. GST)

**Emergency/After-hours (add 50-100%)**
- Weekend: +50%
- After-hours (6pm-6am): +75%
- Public holidays: +100%

**Standard Rates:**
- General laborer: $45-65
- Restoration technician: $65-85
- Specialist (carpenter, plumber): $75-120
- Project supervisor: $85-110

### Material Markup
- Standard: Cost + 15-25%
- Specialty items: Cost + 20-30%
- Emergency supply: Cost + 25-40%

### Equipment Hire (per day, excl. GST)
- Dehumidifier (commercial): $45-85
- Air mover/blower: $25-45
- HEPA vacuum: $35-65
- Air scrubber: $55-95
- Moisture meter: $15-30
- Thermal camera: $85-150

## State-Specific Considerations

### NSW
- Reference NSW Building Code and Fair Trading
- Licensed contractors for electrical, plumbing, gas
- Development consent may be required for major works

### VIC
- Victorian Building Authority (VBA) requirements
- Building permits for structural work
- Registered building practitioners

### QLD

- Cyclone-rated materials in certain areas
- Pool safety compliance

### WA
- Building Services Board registration
- Asbestos awareness certificate required
- Heritage considerations in older properties

### SA
- Development Act compliance
- Essential Safety Provisions (ESP)
- Heritage protection in designated areas

### TAS
- Building Act 2016 requirements
- Bushfire-prone area considerations
- Plumbing permits required

### ACT
- ACT Planning and Land Authority
- Energy efficiency requirements
- Residential tenancy considerations

### NT
- Building Practitioners Board registration
- Cyclone building codes (Top End)
- Termite protection mandatory

## Damage Type Specifics

### Water Damage
- Categorize water (1, 2, or 3)
- Emergency extraction within 24-48 hours
- Moisture mapping and monitoring
- Minimum 3-5 days structural drying
- Anti-microbial treatment for Category 2/3

### Fire Damage
- Structural safety assessment first
- Electrical system inspection mandatory
- HVAC contamination assessment
- Smoke odor neutralization
- Hazardous material (asbestos) testing

### Storm Damage
- Immediate weatherproofing critical
- Structural engineer assessment for major damage
- Emergency tarping/boarding
- Gutter and drainage repair priority
- Insurance documentation important

### Flood Damage
- Treat as Category 3 water
- Complete material removal (contaminated)
- Thorough sanitization required
- Electrical safety critical
- Extended drying periods (7-14 days)

### Mold Damage
- Air quality testing (before and after)
- Containment procedures mandatory
- Source moisture identification critical
- HEPA filtration required
- Post-remediation verification

## Quality Checks
